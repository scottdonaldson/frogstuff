			<h3> Touristy Hidden Gems</h3>
			<p> Ready to pack up your fanny pack and try out some off-the-beaten path museums? Start off the day by heading over to the Colombe a hidden coffee shop in the alley behind the reception gallery. Then walk on over to either the Building Museum or the Postal Museum (or both if you’re feeling frisky!). Once you’re museumed out, drop into either Graffiato’s (funky small plates) or Busboys &amp; Poets (DC institution sandwich shop) for a scrumptious lunch. </p>

			<h3>A Local's Walking Tour</h3>
			<p>Interested in a local’s stroll through DC? Head over to the MT Vernon Metro stop, buy yourself a metro card and take the the green line up to Columbia Heights (no transfers necessary!). Stop by Sticky Fingers (we literally lived three windows above) for a vegan muffin (you won’t even know! we promise!). After wandering through the Park, stop by Pho 14 for lunch and try the veggie Pho (It’s made with apples!). If you’ve still got gas in the engine, you can walk down to Dupont circle where you can check out Books-A-Million or Kramer Books and people watch. See, it’s not all brutalist office building after all! </p>

			<p>In the past 6 years we've lived in seven apartments and not sure we're we'll be moving to in another year. So we request that you don't bring us gifts. We're fortunate enough to have you in our lives (and hopefully at the celebration). Instead of gifts, we'd love to have you make a donation. </p>
